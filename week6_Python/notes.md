# Languages

## Language categories

1. Programming languages are used to write instructions for computers to execute.
   
2.  Markup languages are used to structure and format content, such as text, images, and video. 

3.  Data interchange languages are used to exchange data between systems.
   
4.  Query languages are used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in databases. 

5.  Scripting languages are used to automate tasks and glue together different tools and systems.

## Programming language categories

1.  High-level vs. low-level: 
	> 
	> High-level programming languages are closer to human languages and are easier for humans to read and write. They are typically more abstract and provide higher-level constructs, such as variables, loops, and functions. Low-level programming languages are closer to machine code and are more difficult for humans to read and write. They provide more control over the hardware and are more efficient, but they are less portable and require more effort to use.
    
2. Imperative vs. declarative: 
	 >
	 >Imperative programming languages specify how to perform a task, step by step, using statements that change the state of the program. Declarative programming languages specify what the desired result is, and the language runtime determines how to achieve it.
    
3. Static vs. dynamic: 
	> 
	> Static programming languages are compiled before they are executed, and the type of each variable must be known at compile time. Dynamic programming languages are interpreted at runtime and do not require the type of each variable to be known in advance.
    
4. Object-oriented vs. functional: 
	> 
	> Object-oriented programming languages are based on the idea of objects, which are self-contained entities that contain both data and behavior. Functional programming languages are based on the idea of functions, which are self-contained units of code that take input and produce output.

## Compiled languages

1.  C
2.  C++
3.  C#
4.  Java
5.  Swift
6.  Go
7.  Rust
8.  Kotlin

### Their execution process

- write code
- compile code
- link code
- execute code

## Interpreted languages

Interpreted languages are programming languages that are not compiled into machine code before they are executed. Instead, they are interpreted by a runtime environment, which reads and executes the code line by line

1.  Python
2.  Ruby
3.  JavaScript
4.  PHP
5.  Perl
6.  Bash
7.  Tcl
8.  Lisp
9.  R
10. MATLAB
